Snake Game üêç


This project is a classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle graphics module. 
It includes features such as real-time score tracking, randomized food placement, and smooth snake movement. 
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

Some skills I utilized to make this project are:

  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designed classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard, encapsulating related properties and behaviors.
    
  Event Handling: Implemented key press listeners to control the snake's direction in real-time using screen.listen() and screen.onkey().
    
  Animation with Turtle Graphics: Used the turtle module to create smooth, animated movement of the snake and dynamic placement of food.
    
  Collision Detection: Implemented logic to detect collisions between the snake and the walls, the snake and itself, and the snake and the food.
    
  Randomization: Utilized the random module to generate random positions for the food, adding unpredictability to the game.
    
  Screen Management: Managed the game screen setup, including background color, screen size, title, and screen updates using screen.update() and screen.tracer(0).
    
  Real-Time Score Tracking: Developed a scoreboard that updates in real-time as the snake eats the food, and displays the game over message when the game ends.

  Game Loop Control: Controlled the game flow using a while loop, ensuring continuous movement and periodic screen updates.
